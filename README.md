# 👋 Hey there, I'm Govind!

💻 I'm a curious learner, full-time student at **Shree Shankara Senior Secondary School, Urkura, Raipur (C.G.)**, and part-time debugger of life 😤  
🚀 On a mission to understand **human biology, chemistry**, and maybe... create the next-gen *Super Soldier Serum* (Thunderbolts fan alert 😏).

## 🧠 Fun Facts About Me

- 🔍 I can switch from Pandas `loc` to `iloc` faster than most people switch tabs during an exam.
- 🎬 I treat movies like case studies and fictional characters like research subjects.
- 🧬 My dream is to blend science and tech into something powerful — **think Captain America meets ICMR**.
- 🧠 I enjoy going *deep* into topics. If I study something, I *really* study it — no surface-level stuff here.
- 🧨 My browser has more Stack Overflow tabs open than social media apps.
